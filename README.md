# CarbonQuotaCalculation

Based on the allocated case-study country, an estimate of the country's (in this case Iceland) "fair-share" National Carbon /Co2 Quota  dating from 2015 was calculated. This was based on making a just and equitable contribution to meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. The spreadsheet used is present below along with a report of how this was calculated.
